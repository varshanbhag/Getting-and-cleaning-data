# Getting-and-cleaning-data
#The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
#The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
#You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
#You will be required to submit: 
# 1) a tidy data set as described below, 
# 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
# 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to 
# clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
# You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
# This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Getting-and-cleaning-data repository contains the following files:
## README.md
    The README.md provides details of the contents of this repository
## run_analysis.R
    The run_analysis.R contains the code for doing the following:
    1) Downloading data
    2) Merging the data
    3) Labelling the variable
    4) Formating the variables
    5) A averaged dataset by subjects and activities is the final output
    6) FinalTidyData.txt is the final dataset which is final output
## CodeBook.md
    This has the sequential process of how the run_analysis.R gets and processes the data
